Hello, 
Here you can find my last two projects (within the last ~2 months). 
The folder "matrix modifications" contains C++ code to support matrix transpose and multiplication. More information can be found inside.
The folder "automatic reviews" contains a project I did for fun to show a friend that one could write automatic reviews on Yelp.

Both projects were just for fun/ personal use and not for deployment or anything like that.
